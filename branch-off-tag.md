To branch off a specific tag in Git, follow these steps:

### 1. **Fetch the latest tags (if needed)**
If you donâ€™t already have the latest tags from the remote repository, run:
   ```sh
   git fetch --tags
   ```

### 2. **List available tags** *(optional)*
   ```sh
   git tag
   ```

### 3. **Create a new branch from the tag**
Replace `<tag_name>` with the actual tag you want to branch from:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b <new_branch_name> <tag_name>
   ```
or using the newer `git switch` command:
   ```sh
   git switch -c <new_branch_name> <tag_name>
   ```

### 4. **Push the new branch to the remote (if needed)**
   ```sh
   git push origin <new_branch_name>
   ```

Now, your new branch starts from the tagged commit, and you can start making changes.
