# Philosophy

When working in Git with multiple developers, teams often follow specific **branching strategies and philosophies** to ensure code stability, collaboration efficiency, and traceability. Below are some **common philosophies** used in Git workflows:

---

## **1. "The Remote Repository Holds the Truth"**
### **Philosophy**:
- The **remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)** is the **single source of truth**.
- Local repositories are temporary workspaces; all significant changes must be pushed to the remote.

### **Key Rules**:
✔ Never assume local commits are final until pushed.  
✔ Always **fetch and rebase** before pushing (`git pull --rebase`).  
✔ No force-pushing to shared branches (`git push --force` only on personal branches).

### **Common Commands**:
```sh
git pull --rebase
git push origin <branch>
```

---

## **2. "The Main Branch is Sacred" (Protected Branches)**
### **Philosophy**:
- The **main (or master) branch** should always be **deployable, stable, and protected**.
- No one pushes directly to `main`—changes go through **pull requests (PRs) / merge requests (MRs)**.

### **Key Rules**:
✔ Use **branch protection rules** to enforce PR-based workflows.  
✔ Require **code reviews and CI checks** before merging.  
✔ Enable **"Require rebase before merging"** to avoid merge conflicts.  
✔ Use **merge commits, squashed commits, or rebase-based merges** depending on strategy.

### **Common Commands**:
```sh
git checkout -b feature-xyz
git push origin feature-xyz
# Create PR on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
```

---

## **3. "Feature Branching"**
### **Philosophy**:
- Each feature or bugfix gets its own **branch**.
- Merging only happens after **code review and CI/CD validation**.
- Encourages **clean commit history** and easier rollbacks.

### **Key Rules**:
✔ Keep feature branches **short-lived** (avoid long-running branches).  
✔ Regularly **rebase** to avoid conflicts (`git pull --rebase`).  
✔ Merge back into `main` only after **tests pass**.

### **Common Commands**:
```sh
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin feature/new-feature
# Create PR and merge after review
```

---

## **4. "Trunk-Based Development" (No Long-Lived Feature Branches)**
### **Philosophy**:
- Everyone commits **directly to `main` (or a short-lived branch)**.
- **Frequent integration** with main prevents merge hell.
- Encourages **feature flags** instead of long-lived branches.

### **Key Rules**:
✔ **Small, frequent commits** instead of long-lived feature branches.  
✔ **Feature flags** control unfinished work.  
✔ Avoids the complexity of GitFlow.

### **Common Commands**:
```sh
git checkout main
git pull --rebase
git commit -m "Implement feature flag for XYZ"
git push origin main
```

---

## **5. "GitFlow" (Well-Defined Release Process)**
### **Philosophy**:
- Different branches for **features, releases, hotfixes**.
- Used in **enterprise projects** with scheduled releases.

### **Key Rules**:
✔ `main` holds **stable production code**.  
✔ `develop` is for **ongoing development**.  
✔ `feature/*` for **new work**, `release/*` for releases, and `hotfix/*` for critical fixes.

### **Common Commands**:
```sh
git checkout -b feature/new-feature develop
git commit -m "Implement new feature"
git push origin feature/new-feature
# Merge feature into develop, then merge develop into main
```

---

## **6. "Forking Workflow" (Great for Open Source)**
### **Philosophy**:
- Used in **open-source projects** where contributors don’t have direct write access.
- Developers **fork** the repo, make changes, and submit **pull requests**.

### **Key Rules**:
✔ Work in a **personal fork**, not the main repository.  
✔ Use **upstream sync** to stay up to date.  
✔ Submit **pull requests (PRs)** to contribute.

### **Common Commands**:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/repo.git
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b my-feature upstream/main
git push origin my-feature
# Create PR from your fork to upstream repo
```

---

## **7. "Rebasing Culture vs. Merging Culture"**
### **Philosophy**:
- **Rebase**: Keeps a **clean, linear history**.
- **Merge**: Keeps a **full historical record** of all changes.

### **Key Rules**:
✔ **Rebase before pushing** to avoid messy history.  
✔ Use **merge commits** if tracking when branches were merged is important.  
✔ **Squash commits** when you want a clean history (`git rebase -i`).

### **Common Commands**:
```sh
# Rebasing before pushing
git pull --rebase
git push origin feature-branch

# Interactive rebase to clean up commits
git rebase -i HEAD~5
```

## **Which Philosophy to Choose?**
| Philosophy                         | Best For |
|-------------------------------------|---------|
| **Remote Holds the Truth**          | Any team |
| **Protected Main Branch**           | Large teams, critical systems |
| **Feature Branching**               | Agile teams, most projects |
| **Trunk-Based Development**         | Fast-moving teams, startups |
| **GitFlow**                         | Enterprise, scheduled releases |
| **Forking Workflow**                | Open-source projects |
| **Rebasing Culture vs. Merging**    | Depends on team preference |

---

## **Conclusion**
Each Git philosophy has trade-offs. **For most teams**, a combination of:
✅ **Protected `main` branch**  
✅ **Feature branching**  
✅ **Rebase before pushing**  
✅ **Pull requests with reviews**  
works best.
