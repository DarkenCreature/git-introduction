Since you're conducting a workshop on Git, here are some **Git best practices** that will be useful for both beginners and advanced users. These cover areas like commit hygiene, branching strategies, collaboration, and security.

---

### **1. Commit Best Practices**
- **Keep commits small and atomic**
    - Each commit should have a single responsibility (e.g., "Fix bug in user authentication" instead of "Fix bugs and refactor database queries").
- **Write meaningful commit messages**
    - Follow the convention:
      ```
      <type>: <short description>
  
      <optional longer description>
      ```
      Example:
      ```
      feat: Add user authentication via JWT
  
      - Implement login with JWT tokens
      - Store tokens securely in HTTP-only cookies
      ```
- **Commit only relevant changes**
    - Avoid committing unnecessary files (e.g., IDE settings, logs). Use `.gitignore` to prevent them from being tracked.

### **2. Branching and Workflow Best Practices**
- **Use a branching strategy**
    - **GitFlow** (for complex projects)
    - **GitHub Flow** (for simpler projects)
    - **Trunk-based development** (for fast-paced CI/CD environments)
- **Use descriptive branch names**
    - Example:
        - `feature/user-authentication`
        - `bugfix/fix-login-redirect`
        - `hotfix/security-vulnerability`
- **Rebase instead of merging for clean history**
    - Use `git rebase` for feature branches before merging to avoid unnecessary merge commits.
    - Example:
      ```sh
      git checkout feature-branch
      git rebase main
      ```
- **Avoid long-lived branches**
    - Keep feature branches short-lived and merge them quickly to avoid conflicts.

---

### **3. Collaboration Best Practices**
- **Use Pull Requests (PRs) for code reviews**
    - Enforce PR reviews before merging.
    - Provide clear descriptions of changes.
- **Squash and merge for cleaner history**
    - Helps keep the commit history readable.
- **Resolve conflicts properly**
    - Don't blindly accept incoming changes. Carefully review and test merged code.

### **4. Security and Performance Best Practices**
- **Never commit secrets**
    - Use environment variables or secret management tools instead.
    - Consider using `git-secrets` or `pre-commit hooks` to prevent accidental secret commits.
- **Sign commits (optional but good for security)**
    - Use GPG or SSH to sign commits for authenticity.
    - Example:
      ```sh
      git commit -S -m "feat: Implement secure authentication"
      ```
- **Optimize repository size**
    - Avoid committing large binary files (use Git LFS if needed).
    - Regularly prune and clean up old branches.

---

### **5. Handling Mistakes Gracefully**
- **Use `git stash` to save work-in-progress changes**
- **Undo mistakes with caution**
    - `git reset --soft HEAD~1` (Undo last commit but keep changes)
    - `git checkout -- <file>` (Discard unstaged changes)
    - `git reflog` (Recover lost commits)
